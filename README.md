GET /films/1

Example Response: { "id": "1", "title": "The Giant Gila Monster", "runtime": "108", "capacity": 30, "showtime": "04:00PM", "tickets_sold": 27, "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.", "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg" }

See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the ul#films element when the page loads. (optional: you can style each film in the list by adding the classes film item to each li element.) There is a placeholder li in the ul#films element that is hardcoded in the HTML — feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list.
